#### The following are some examples. (Note that API keys are hidden. Please get your own API keys.)

<br>
First we search for a spefic author:

{% highlight python %}
from scopus import Scopus
scopus = Scopus(key)
# search for Andrew Ng
query_dict = {'affil': 'Stanford University', 'authfirst': 'Andrew', 'authlast': 'Ng'}
author_results = scopus.search_author(query_dict)
{% endhighlight %}

This returns `author_results` as a [Panda DataFrame object](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) and print the following output: 
<pre><code>A total number of  1  records for the query.
           affiliation    author_id  document_count       name
0  Stanford University  35410071600             165  Andrew Ng
</code></pre>


Then we search for his publication information using his unique author id `35410071600`:

{% highlight python %}
andrew_pubs = scopus.search_author_publication('35410071600')
{% endhighlight %}

`andrew_pubs` is also a DataFrame object and the search will output a list of publication names:

We can also search for a certain publication using its Scopus id:
{% highlight python %}
pub_info = scopus.search_abstract('0141607824')
{% endhighlight %}

The resulting `pub_info` is a dictionary containing the meta data of the specified publication. Similar to previous queries, it will by default print the info as standard output.
